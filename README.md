Just wrapped up an end-to-end Supply Chain Management Dashboard using Power BI, DAX, and SQL!
Here’s how each part of the dashboard brings critical insights to life:

1. Order Details View

This page highlights the lifecycle of car orders—showcasing customer behavior across time, shipping preferences, and ordering patterns. It's designed to detect peak order months, track delivery methods, and even analyze trends by gender, all in a clean, filterable interface.

2. Sales Insights View

The sales dashboard brings powerful clarity to revenue performance. It breaks down total sales by month, quarter, and shipping method, offering a strategic view of what’s driving revenue. Car color insights and model preferences are also visualized—perfect for guiding production and marketing strategies.

3. Customer Deep Dive

This section allows for drill-down analysis by individual customer. You can filter by car model, customer name, region, or feedback, making it easier to assess loyalty, satisfaction, and buying trends. It's a customer-first lens on the supply chain.

4. Visuals & Interactivity

Using DAX measures and SQL queries for backend logic, each visualization is designed for clarity and storytelling. Filters, slicers, and color-coded charts make the data not just informative—but intuitive.
